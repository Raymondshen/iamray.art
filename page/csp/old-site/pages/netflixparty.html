                <p>
                    User data was scarce due to the lack of investment and importance in user data tracking analytic
                    tools. The only data analytics I had access to were insights of live daily & monthly active users,
                    along with the number of uninstalls and new user installations. With limited data, I decided to use
                    these insights to determine if design changes were working or if it isn't working based on
                    <b>customer
                        retention and churns</b>.

                <p>
                    There was an abundance of user feedback mainly based on digital form, reviews from chrome store, and
                    insights from support emails. Lots of ideas were gained based on research and collected data with
                    learnings on what key features, problems, challenges, and improvements could be made to reduce churn
                    but also to improve the product’s overall user experience. Some of the critical learning pain-points
                    discovered through user feedback were <b>A. Setting up the party</b>, <b>B. Hiding chat bar</b>, and
                    <b>C. A complex
                        learning curve</b> requiring users to dig deep in understanding the product usage.
                </p>
                <p class="note">
                    Researched and reviewed over 1,000 out of 10,000+ emails to better understand user needs, product
                    problems, features, and improvements.

                    end-goal. Based on the user flow, I had proposed several solutions to improve it’s current user
                    experiences by: <b>A. Reducing the number of steps</b> required to start a party,
                    <b>B. Redesign functionalities</b> that are more visible and discoverable, and <b>C. Enhancing user

                    One of the central frictions that prevented users from reaching their goal was the lack of
                    visibility and discoverability requiring a <b>deep learning curve</b> from users ( which was the
                    leading
                    cause 90% of the time users uninstall or think its “broken” ). Another insight was the lack of
                    features requested by the community needing to have video chat & audio along with several other
                    features. Lastly, the product lacked simple, fun activities that make the party enjoyable, fun, and
                    impactful experience.

                        trust, familiarity, and recognition towards users. Consistency was another vital aspect of
                        ensuring that all assets, colors, logos, and icons are consistent in order to bring delightful
                        experiences to users.

                        Popular chat platforms influenced the overall redesign layout of the extension. Design decisions
                        were made based on familiarity and consistency placements of where standard navigation, chat
                        input, icons, and buttons are typically found. Using this knowledge as a basis helps reduce the
                        amount of effort and time required for users to learn the new placement and layout of the
                        extension.

                        What I’ve learned throughout the years at Netflix Party

                        My experiences and learnings at Netflix Party

                    <p>
                        I joined Netflix Party in the second year of college, after being recommended by a previous CEO
                        I’ve interned for as a designer. Working at Netflix Party, my responsibilities were tasked to
                        produce, oversee, and develop all assets, design, and branding for the company.
                        <br><br>
                        In the first few months working at Netflix Party, I was pretty scared, being that my first task
                        was to work
                        on a large scale project by myself. The role was profoundly challenging without any guidance on
                        how to approach a large-scale redesign project that I wasn’t familiar with. Though I learned a
                        lot throughout the months, making small to large-scale mistakes, not conducting sufficient user
                        research, testing, and data. But over time, I quickly learned that the quality of importance and
                        time needed to be spent on brainstorming, conducting user research, and understanding user
                        behavior before working on visual design is vitally important to improve any product redesign
                        and user experiences.
                        <br><br>
                        As of today, I still work at Netflix Party as a designer managing multiple projects from
                        branding to development and product designing. I had learned a lot throughout the years,
                        figuring out to manage large-scale redesign projects, working with developers, and understanding
                        the process of creating a product to designing and executing for production. Over the years,
                        there were multiple improvements, changes, proposed features, micro, and macro iterations to the
                        extension & website made to improve the product’s user experience based on user data, research,
                        and feedback. Today I’m still working on improving the product’s user experience and figuring
                        out other macro and micro challenges that users face.
