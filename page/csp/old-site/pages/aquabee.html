                    filtration speed, temperature, and other necessities in a regular aquarium often require to get your
                    hand dirty, wet, and in which this also affects the water quality.

                        Insights and understanding of user behavior helped drive the design decision making of the home
                        screen for where the core functionalities would live. Findability and usability were also the
                        core driving principles of creating a simplistic interface aimed to reduce the required learning
                        curve and attention span from users.

                        Brand identity and a set of a design system are essential to keep consistency across the whole
                        platform of the app and website for Aqua Bee. Branding colors were applied on the web and app to
                        keep a consistent brand identity of trust, familiarity, and differences among other competing
                        companies.

                    How'd I got here? What was the design and development process?
                </h2>

                <p class="summary">
                    Researching products, companies, and structural build based on modern fish tanks were the initial
                    steps of solving the design problems that aquarists routinely goes through. Learning about who my
                    target audiences are, understanding their behavior, and needs were also essential user data that
                    helped shape my design decisions. During the process of designing the product, I faced multiple
                    constraints:
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The lack of knowledge in what functionality, parts, and technology could be implemented in
                            Aqua Bee's fish tank was challenging.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            User and product research was limited due to the constraints of the given project timeline
                        </p>

                <p>
                    Sketching and research were the initial steps of developing the concept and visual idea of the
                    product. It's also the early phases of my design process where brainstorming, site mapping,
                    information architecture, and quick wireframing sketches would help shape the final outcome of this
                    project.

                <p>
                    Researching competitors was essential to understanding what improvements, threats, strengths, and
                    weaknesses that the current product stands within the market. A list of competitors consist of:
                    Petco, PetSmart, Live Aquaria, BigAlsPets, Marine Depot.

                <p>
                    Given the limited amount of time to gather user research based on my targeted audiences, I was able
                    to acquire some insights in the age group of fish hobbyists to gauge and help inform the product
                    design process.

                    Creating a sitemap helped me visualize the overall pages, screen, and layout of potential
                    possibilities that could be implemented, but to also eliminate any unnecessary, redundant sections.

                    Based on data, research, and insights gathered throughout the initial stages of brainstorming and
