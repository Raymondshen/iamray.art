              In September of 2019, I joined HireClub as a designer to help
              redesign the company’s products, digital marketing assets, and
              prints for the company. Most of the existing product, website, and
              mobile app wasn’t up to date for years, so I was responsible for
              updating and improving the designs.
            </p>
            <p class="txt-body pjt-paragraph">
              The biggest challenge was to improve the design around an existing
              branding and product. Its initial product app and website had a
              poor user experience, which confused a lot of users. Inconsistency
              and branding also led to a lack of trust among users. Months of
              brainstorming sessions and discussions were held with the founder,
              product manager, and engineering team to improve the company’s
              product, revenue, and branding. The brainstorming session outcome
              focused on enhancing the company’s website design, mobile app
              design, digital advertisement, and user experience.
            </p>
            <p class="txt-body pjt-paragraph">
              As a result, I helped redesign the company’s internal web pages
              and build a new onboarding user experience to provide a delightful
              user experience for new prospects. In addition, I worked on
              designs for the company’s print, pitch decks, and digital
              marketing assets.

              Through user research, testing, and analysis, I helped redesign
              the onboarding system to be responsive to web and mobile layouts.
              I also redesigned internal components and features, improving the
              structural hierarchy and design.
