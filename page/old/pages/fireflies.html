                    The lack of branding in its early stages caused a lot of inconsistency and confusion across multiple
                    SaaS platforms offered to customers. Within the various products that Fireflies.ai offered either
                    consisted of different colors, text, and layout, which prompts questioning of the company's
                    legitimacy among users and the differentiating against other competing products in the market.

                <p>
                    Fireflies.ai chrome extension’s initial design gravely lacked the necessary visibility & proper

                    missing, or out of the ordinarily expected placement leading to a complicated learning curve and

                    The company's landing page navigability was sophisticated and confusing for many new users. It
                    lacked branding and unity in assets that would help set the company apart from other products in the
                    market. Poor user flow, hierarchy, and layout design also led to fewer customers and conversion
                    rates.

                    The development of user stories came from other departments given to me for a better grasp of

                    Laying out the original SaaS product user flow brings clarity and vision on what current problems,

                    and website redesign.

                    enhancements, or iterations could be made to create a better user experience.

                    research, learnings, and data information collected were given to me to understand better what
                    improvements were to be made on the mockups.

                    From the given conducted user research and data, I've learned that drastic iterations and
                    improvements were necessary on several different projects. The email redesign lacked color contrast
                    as clients had found it hard to distinguish between the two texts within the same line. On the
                    website mockup redesign, feedbacks were given that it needed change and improvements of the overall
                    visual hierarchy on several different pages. As for the extension mockup, improvements were needed
                    in areas where user interactions aren't prominent or accessible, which was disrupting the product
                    user experience.

                        To improve the transcript scannability, I redesigned the document by improving its hierarchy,
                        contrast, spacing, and separation to emphasize valuable information and visibility to users. The
                        redesign incorporated colors to help differentiate between important and unimportant information
                        within a paragraph, sentence, or article. Contrast also helped improve reader scannability and
                        user attention by alleviating the strenuous work of reading through a block of text. Hierarchy,
                        spacing, and separation also improve user experiences by leading the eye with focus and
                        differentiation of importance between blocks of text and sections of contents.

                        essential area in developing the sketches and wireframes for user testing. With the redesign, I
                        focused on improving the usability of the product by designing buttons that's easily
                        discoverable and visible to users increasing the success chance of users reaching their intended
                        goals. Contrast, hierarchy, colors, and other design elements were also incorporated to improve
                        the visual readability and user experiences. Further improvements and iterations were made based
                        on validation of client feedback and user testing conducted by other departments.

                    <p>
                        Fireflies.ai is my first company and internship I've worked at as a designer during my second
                        year of college. I was responsible for most of the company's foundational redesign and
                        development of their branding & products.
                        <br><br>
                        During my internship, I learned a lot in the first two months working alongside different
                        departments by understanding the importance and contribution they make in meeting the project's
                        deadline. In the early stages, I struggled a bit in getting used to the workflow, daily
                        meetings, and showcasing design works and changes I've made for the project. But over time, I
                        overcame that struggle and anxiety from proposing, presenting, and explaining my design changes
                        in front of multiple departments within the company. I also learned a lot from working on
                        numerous design projects such as designing: pitch decks, marketing material/template, website,
                        email, transcript, chrome extension, and HTML & CSS development.
                        <br><br>
                        Throughout my internship experiences at Fireflies.ai, I had learned and gained a lot of
                        different skills and knowledge from working at a SaaS start-up company. I gained a lot of
                        insights and experiences as a designer as I had the chance to work with multiple departments
                        with various work processes, delivery systems, and communication processes. It has also improved
                        my career and profession as a designer by understanding how to manage and approach numerous
                        design projects and problems that I had never worked on at hand. Overall, the main takeaways
                        I've gained working at Fireflies.ai as an intern was:
