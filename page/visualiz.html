              Visualiz is a startup company in Texas aimed to change the way
              small businesses and consumers interact with each other through
              augmented reality. I started off as an intern at this startup
              company and helped work on transforming their ideas into a mobile
              app.
            </p>
            <p class="txt-body pjt-paragraph">
              The initial app lacked branding, contrast, structure, and
              hierarchy leading to poor user experiences. The other challenge
              for me was understanding how to design augmented reality.
              Therefore, before I started working on preparing the company
              branding and mobile app UI, I had to conduct my own personal
              research, studies, analysis, and understanding of the market and
              competitors.
            </p>
            <p class="txt-body pjt-paragraph">
              As a result, I delivered the final version mockups of the mobile
              app UI based on research, discussions, feedback, and inspiration
              over several months.
