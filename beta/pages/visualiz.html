                    potential competitive companies of similar products, platforms, and services. I also gather further
                    information from the CEOs about any known competitors to quickly assess and define what the
                    strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats are for Visualiz.

                    Gathering user feedback was extremely scarce, limited, and insufficient. The position was remote
                    work, so gathering data required my own personal time to conduct simple user testing over the course
                    of a week to gain insights on users' thoughts, challenges, and feedback.

                    The company didn't have branding to form consistency and unity across its assets, which misled many
                    users in questioning whether the product legitimacy should be trusted. It also lacked an identity to
                    represent and differentiate itself from other app platforms that serve similar services within its
                    market place.

                    The user stories were developed by the companies CEO and COO directly provided to me as the basis to
                    efficiently boost the redesign and development progress before the launch date. The company provided
                    me with three use cases & user stories to help me build up a better understanding of my users who,
                    what, and why needs of the product when approaching the redesign.

                <p>
                    I mapped out the initially designed user flow to help identify and define problems, pain-points, and
                    improvements that could be magnified or removed to increase users’ goal achievement. With the user
                    flow mapped out, I changed, restructured, and removed any unnecessary step and process throughout
                    the product to improve the product’s user experiences. Through the process, I proposed several
                    redesign changes that consisted of: A. Reducing steps that weren’t necessarily needed or caused a
                    roadblock for users during the onboarding process and B. simplifying the navigation to ease
                    usability and accessibility problems.

                    users not understanding how to navigate between specific pages assigned to them.

                    experience, and provide further feedback on what changes and improvements were necessary. From
                    there, I conducted another round of user testing with a clickable prototype made through Invision.
                    The goal was to determine whether further changes, iterations, and feedback made from the previous
                    sessions had improved or worsened the overall user experience and the task at hand.

                    amount of time I had to conduct a sufficient amount of user testing. During the research process, I
                    did learn that many of the placements, features, and implementation we thought would be helpful
                    during the brainstorming session had slightly hindered and sometimes negatively impacted the user's
                    ability to reach their tasked goals. On the other hand, I also notice the positive impact in user
                    engagement due to a slight change in the user flow by reducing any redundant pages and steps users
                    needed to take to reach their tasked goal at hand.

                        Designing the AR user interface
                    </i>
                    <p>
                        The AR functionality lets users scan their local areas to collect available coupons and tickets
                        from nearby shops and businesses. When I designed the AR screen for Visualiz, it was quite a
                        challenge as I had to keep in mind on how the app would determine location, places, and the
                        interactivity between user, app, and environment.
                        <br><br>
                        The solution in designing the AR screens came from multiple sources of inspiration, such as
                        google maps, scavenger, NBA basketball AR, and studies on how to design for AR screens. When
                        designing the AR functionality, I kept three main problems at hand that needed to be solved:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>A design that integrates both the digital and physical world seamlessly.</b>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b> How particular surface, lighting, shadows, objects affect or interact with the app &
                                    users would affect or interact with the app.</b>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Determining whether the design would be a fixed screen in space, real-world related,
                                    or
                                    object-related.</b>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        Based on the provided specs of its AR functionality. Users can interact and see coupons,
                        discounts, events, and other uploaded user videos through their phones. With those specs in
                        mind, I applied a fixed screen container at the bottom of the AR interface where users could
                        collect, discover, and find the current deals and coupons of nearby businesses around them. To
                        ensure that the AR design integrates seamlessly, I made sure that the AR interface could work
                        around multiple environments, weather, and sceneries. With google map's recent implementation of
                        their AR functionality, I decided to use that similar idea and applied it to visualiz's
                        platform. The app would intake user location, environment, and data from the inputted source of
                        local businesses that participated in our platform. Businesses that participated in our platform
                        can upload coupons, on-going events, photos, that'll inform nearby users of available digital
                        tickets that could be collected used within those specific shops.
                    </p>

                        My experiences and learnings @ Visualiz
                    </i>
                    <p>
                        I onboarded Visualiz team as a design intern with a 2-month contract to help redesign, research,
                        and develop their product & brand identity. During my time working at Visualiz, I learned a lot
                        about the importance of understanding its business goals, different department roles, and the
                        process of designing and executing a project to production.
                        <br><br>
                        Working at Visualiz as their first-time designer was quite a challenge because the product was
                        at its very first stage of production. As a designer, I was responsible for conducting user
                        research, testing, development of its brand identity, and product redesign to improve its user
                        flow and user experiences. One of the main constraints and challenges I faced was the limited
                        amount of time I had to collect user data. Another problem I faced was communication, which was
                        often slow because of different time zones and locations the team lived in. Lastly, the most
                        difficult challenge was designing the augmented reality user interfaces due to my lack of
                        inexperienced skills and knowledge of its functionalities.
                        <br><br>
                        The challenges I faced during my internship were essential lessons I've learned, gained, and
                        improved throughout the two-month as a designer. With a limited amount of time to conduct user
                        research, I was forced to learn new ways of gathering user data. I resulted in utilizing digital
                        research articles, blogs, and forums of the subject and answers I was seeking for and needed at
                        hand. I also learned the importance of communication when working in a team to quickly and
                        efficiently execute projects before the deadline. Lastly, I expanded my knowledge and skills as
                        a designer from learning, studying, and researching AR possibilities, problems, limitations, and
                        features that could or couldn't be implemented on mobile applications. At the end of my
                        internship, I learned a lot about working in remote teams and how to manage projects efficiently
                        as an individual designer.
