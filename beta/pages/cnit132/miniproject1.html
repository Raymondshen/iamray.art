    <p>
      My name is Raymond Shen, and I am a Designer @Teleparty based in San
      Francisco, CA. Graduated with a B.F.A degree in Web Design & New Media.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently a Designer @Teleparty. In the past recent years, I also
      worked at Hireclub and Fireflies.ai. I combine user research, wireframing,
      prototyping, psychology, & development to transform complex problems into
      delightful & engaging solutions. With studies in Web Design & New Media, I
      understand the constraints for both development on the web and can adapt
      and design solutions around them effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of my path for web development I want to constantly learn and
      progress with the newest updates to both HTML, CSS, and Javscript. In
      addition to that hopefully I can become a front-end developer in addition
      to back-end / software development. Aside from that I want to also get
      more into the space of interactive coding. One of my favorite websites
      would be french creative developer in Japan name
      <a href="https://renaudrohlinger.com/" target="_blank"
        >Renaud Rohlinger</a
      >
      . His website is definitely interactive, fun, but also has it's own
      aesthetics and character.
